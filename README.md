# Object-Oriented Programming Chatbot
We have created a chatbot using IBM Watson Assistant to interpret and answer object-oriented programming questions. 

Students taking an object-oriented class can use the chatbot to help answer common questions about the subject. The chatbot will return a well explained response to questions regarding the concepts that make up object-oriented programming. The chatbot has the ability to define the basic concepts of object-oriented programming as well as give examples using Java.
