# Object-Oriented Programming Chatbot
We have created a chatbot using IBM Watson Assistant that can interpret and answer object-oriented programming questions. 

Users can ask questions regarding the concepts that make up object-oriented programming and the chatbot will return a well-explained answer. The chatbot has the ability to define the basic concepts of object-oriented programming as well as give examples using Java.

## Tech
* [IBM Watson Assistant]
* [particles.js]





## Installation
To edit the chatbot functionality you need to import the dialog skill into your IBM Watson Assistant service. 

<ins>For a new Watson Assistant service</ins>: launch your Watson Assistant tool, click on skills, click on add dialog skill, click on import skill, and then select the skill-OOP-Main.json file in the data folder.

<ins>For a Watson Assistant service with existing dialog skill</ins>: launch your Waton Assistant tool, click on skills, open dialog skill options, click on swap skill, click on import skill, and then select the skill-OOP-Main.json file in the data folder.

For more information about importing and exporting dialog skills you can visit this [link].





## Usage
To open the project in your browser, run the chatbot.html file and the webpage will open in your default browser and allow you to use the chatbot.

To upload the website to your web server, use FTP to upload chatbot.html and the scripts folder to your web server. Since the chatbot is called through the HTML file there are no additional files for the chatbot.
